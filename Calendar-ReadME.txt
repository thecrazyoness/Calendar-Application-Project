This is my Calendar App for the project.
If you're reading this in notepad or something similar to that, you have downloaded the file from github.
Now you can either watch the video or double click on the 'login' html to start using the App.
It will prompt you for a unername and password, the username is: 'admin' and the password is: '1234'
After that you will be sent to the actual calendar, just click on any date and the 'create event' form will apper.
